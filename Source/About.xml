  <description>Apex: Rimworld Legends is a vanilla-friendly weapon expansion adding over 20 new weapons to the game, all based on Apex: Legends weapons, but renamed into more general weapon types. VK-47 Flatline became a Bullpup Rifle, Wingman became a Hand Cannon and Mozambique is still useless. The graphics, sounds and statistics of these weapons are meant to represent unmodded Rimworld, with no weapon being overpowered or “Out of character”. Charge weapons have been expanded allowing for extra variety in combat, no longer forcing players to use a Charge rifle in late game. A new tier of late game weaponry has been added called “Mechanoid Weapons”, which becomes craftable after researching Johnson-Tanaka drive - One of the last available technologies before leaving the planet.
